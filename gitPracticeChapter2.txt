	I've heard over the years, that knowledge is power; stressing its importance, which is a good matter of fact, at least its way better than the position of ignorance. 
	
	But i have some thoughts; the first is that there is a lot of information around, we have better access to information which is the bedrock of knowledge, compared to previous age is like an explosion that has rocked the strata.
	However, we have knowledgable people, they read a lot, even do some level of research but are quite dumb. For instance, looking at marriage we have recorded more divorce cases than previous generations, who had less access to information than this does. They had successes....now there books available, myriad of stories of marriages that ended in shambles, plus materials of those that did succede are quite available now than ever before.


	Next thought is a question. Is knowledge on its own powerful or how it is used by it's career that makes that makes it powerful?! Just like Potential and kinetic energy...power of residence and power of impact. I would want presume that knowledge on its own can be valuable, but without a vessel it's useless, and without useful vessel it's mediocre. 

	It seeks who it can control, and best seeks who can master it. It can equip you for good or for evil, for wisdom or for foolishness. I think i've written my way to some answers. In a nutshell be careful about how and what you consume.
